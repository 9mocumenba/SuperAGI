Medical imaging is a field that uses various techniques to create images of the human body for diagnosis, treatment and research purposes. Medical imaging can reveal the structure, function and pathology of different organs and tissues, as well as the effects of diseases and interventions.
 
Medical imaging involves physics, engineering and clinical applications. Physics is the science that explains the principles and phenomena behind the different imaging modalities, such as X-rays, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine and optical imaging. Engineering is the discipline that designs, develops and optimizes the devices, systems and algorithms that enable the acquisition, processing and display of medical images. Clinical applications are the domains that use medical imaging to address specific medical problems and needs, such as radiology, cardiology, neurology, oncology and surgery.

## Medical Imaging Modalities
 
There are various medical imaging modalities that use different techniques and energy sources to create images of the human body. Each modality has its advantages and limitations, depending on the purpose and target of the imaging. Some of the most common medical imaging modalities are:
 
- **X-ray**: This modality uses beams of electromagnetic waves (x-rays) to produce radiographs that depict the tissues in two dimensions based on their density. X-ray is commonly used for assessment of chest, abdominal and skeletal anatomy[^1^].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: This modality uses X-ray beams to produce images that depict the tissues in two and three dimensions based on their density. CT is commonly used for assessment of musculoskeletal system, parenchyma of solid organs, distribution of body fluids[^1^] [^2^].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: This modality uses radio-waves and magnetic fields to produce images based on the tissueâs proton (hydrogen) levels. MRI is commonly used for examination of soft and nervous tissues[^1^] [^2^].
- **Ultrasonography (U/S)**: This modality uses high frequency sound waves to depict tissues based on their density. U/S has a wide array of indications, such as Doppler U/S, breast U/S, obstetric U/S[^1^] [^2^].
- **Nuclear medicine imaging**: This is a spectrum of imaging methods that use gamma-radiation emitting radiopharmaceuticals (radioactive pharmaceuticals) to examine the function of specific body parts. A common method is positron emission tomography (PET) scan[^1^] [^3^].

These are some of the main medical imaging modalities that are used in clinical practice. Each modality has its own principles, techniques, applications and risks. To learn more about them, you can refer to Introduction to Medical Imaging: Physics, Engineering and Clinical Applications RAR.
