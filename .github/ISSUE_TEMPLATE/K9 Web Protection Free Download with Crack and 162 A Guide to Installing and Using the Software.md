K9 Web Protection is a popular software that blocks harmful and inappropriate websites, ads, and malware. It also allows parents to control what their children can access online. However, the software is no longer supported by its original developer, Blue Coat Systems, which was acquired by Symantec in 2016. This means that you cannot get a license key to activate the software anymore.
